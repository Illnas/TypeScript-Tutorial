TypeScript Tutorial

I was delaying learning TypeScript as much as I could, but I am realising that it 
is becoming a "must have" skill for frontend developer. So, this is first tutorial I am doing on TypeScript.

So far, I am on basic part of the tutorial, finished variables, data types and functions.
Lecturer is good at explaining things and lessons were easy to understand.

Finished lesson, finally! It was kinda slow, but it was normal, since it was aimed at beginners. I don't have much
experience with Typescript to create an opinion on it, so next step is tutorial on React Typescript and implement 
Typescript into new Project I am doing.
