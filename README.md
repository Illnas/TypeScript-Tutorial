TypeScript Tutorial

I was delaying learning TypeScript as much as I could, but I am realising that it 
is becoming a "must have" skill for frontend developer. So, this is first tutorial I am doing on TypeScript.

So far, I am on basic part of the tutorial, finished variables, data types and functions.
Lecturer is good at explaining things and lessons were easy to understand.
